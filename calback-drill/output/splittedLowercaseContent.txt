shall i compare thee to a summer's day?
thou art more lovely and more temperate:
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may,
and summer's lease hath all too short a date:
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
and often is his gold complexion dimmed;
and every fair from fair sometime declines,
by chance or nature's changing course untrimmed:
but thy eternal summer shall not fade,
nor lose possession of that fair thou'st now;
nor shall death brag thou wand'rest from the way,
when time shall age unrinded brow.
no, when death shall call thee from this earth,
thou shalt live in eternal summer.
