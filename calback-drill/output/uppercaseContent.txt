SHALL I COMPARE THEE TO A SUMMER'S DAY?
THOU ART MORE LOVELY AND MORE TEMPERATE:
ROUGH WINDS DO SHAKE THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY,
AND SUMMER'S LEASE HATH ALL TOO SHORT A DATE:
SOMETIME TOO HOT THE EYE OF HEAVEN SHINES,
AND OFTEN IS HIS GOLD COMPLEXION DIMMED;
AND EVERY FAIR FROM FAIR SOMETIME DECLINES,
BY CHANCE OR NATURE'S CHANGING COURSE UNTRIMMED:
BUT THY ETERNAL SUMMER SHALL NOT FADE,
NOR LOSE POSSESSION OF THAT FAIR THOU'ST NOW;
NOR SHALL DEATH BRAG THOU WAND'REST FROM THE WAY,
WHEN TIME SHALL AGE UNRINDED BROW.
NO, WHEN DEATH SHALL CALL THEE FROM THIS EARTH,
THOU SHALT LIVE IN ETERNAL SUMMER.
