Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed:
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou'st now;
Nor shall Death brag thou wand'rest from the way,
When Time shall age unrinded brow.
No, when Death shall call thee from this earth,
Thou shalt live in eternal summer.
